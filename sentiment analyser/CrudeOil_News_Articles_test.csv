Crude Drifts Lower On EIA Inventory Report.html,"Crude oil prices drifted lower today after the Energy Information Administration reported an oil inventory build of 3.3 million barrels for the week to October 29. This compared with a build of 4.3 million barrels that paused the oil price rally last week. The authority also reported mixed results in gasoline and middle distillates. In gasoline, the EIA estimated an inventory decline of 1.5 million barrels for the seven days to October 29, with production averaging 10.2 million bpd.
 This compared with a stock draw of 2 million barrels for the previous week and average daily production of 10.1 million bpd. In middle distillates, the EIA reported an inventory build of 2.2 million barrels for the week to October 29. This compared with a decline of 400,000 barrels estimated for the previous week. Production of middle distillates averaged 4.8 million bpd last week, which compared with 4.6 million bpd a week earlier. Oil prices were down at the time of writing after the American Petroleum Institute estimated a crude oil inventory build of almost 3.6 million barrels. This was the sixth consecutive inventory build estimate by the API.
 Prices, however, remain elevated as OPEC+ sticks to its plan to add a moderate amount of oil to global supply every month despite higher demand and pleas from major consumers. The extended cartel is meeting tomorrow for its monthly update on policy but major surprises are unlikely. Signals from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq, among others, have pointed in the direction of continued supply discipline. Some of that discipline is not voluntary, however. Several OPEC members are struggling to boost production by the agreed amount because of years of underinvestment and insufficient maintenance. As a result, OPEC+ has been adding less than the agreed 400,000 bpd to global supply. Even that, however, doesn’t seem to be enough to motivate those members of the group that can increase production to do it."

Biden OPEC And Russia Must Pump More Oil To Help Americas Working Class.html,"The refusal of OPEC+ to increase crude oil production is affecting America's working class, President Biden said at a news conference following the G20 meeting in Rome. ""I do think that the idea that Russia and Saudi Arabia and other major producers are not going to pump more oil so people can have gasoline to get to and from work, for example, is not, is not, right,"" Biden said as quoted by Russian TASS. ""It [OPEC+'s decision to keep a lid on output increases] has profound impact on working class families just to get back and forth to work,"" the U.S. President added, as quoted by NPR. The comments made by the U.S. President were later the same day echoed more bluntly by Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who directly blamed the OPEC cartel for keeping prices high.
 ""Gas prices, of course, are based on a global oil market. That oil market is controlled by a cartel. That cartel is Opec,"" Granholm told NBC's Meet the Press. ""So that cartel has more say about what is going on."" At the same time, Granholm noted that the oil industry could not ""flip a switch"" for production as it recovers from the effects of the pandemic and this, too, contributed to higher prices resulting from the tight supply.  Even if factors influencing gas prices at the pump in the United States may be outside the country, the effects of price movements are already costing Biden approval among voters. According to NPR, his rating is well below 50 percent, with 70 percent of Americans believing the country is not going in the right direction.
 Also at the news conference, the U.S. President said he was confident the country could meet his administration's goal of emission cuts, which is 50 percent from 2005 by 2030. Yet, the president acknowledged that the renewable shift cannot happen overnight. ""On the surface, it seems like an irony,"" Biden said, referring to his call on OPEC+ to add more oil production while heading for COP26 to discuss the reduction of global emissions. ""But the truth of the matter is ... everyone knows that idea that we're going to be able to move to renewable energy overnight ... it's just not rational."""
Exxon And Chevron Post Blockbuster Earnings Amid Oil Price Rally.html,"It was supposed to be a blockbuster quarter for energy names thanks to the ongoing surge in oil prices and it did not disappoint: earlier today Chevron reported stellar Q3 earnings, beating on the top and bottom line, with EPS of $2.96 (beating expectations of $2.21), the highest since Q1 2013 on improved market conditions, leading the energy giant to weigh more share buybacks while reining in spending after surging natural gas prices and oil-refining returns drove the U.S. supermajor’s free cash flow to an all-time high. Then moments ago, Exxon Mobil also posted its biggest profit in seven years with Free Cash Flow beating estimates and surprisingly pledging to spend as much as $10 billion on share buybacks over the next 12-24 months. Looking at the press release, Exxon earned an adjusted $1.58 a share during the third quarter, just above the $1.56 average estimate while adjusted net income reached $6.8 billion, the most since 2014. One year ago, the company lost $650 million amid crashing oil prices. Here is what Exxon reported for Q3: Q3 highlights:  Comparing Q3 to Q2 earnings, the company highlighted a $2.1 billion improvement in earnings:  Production: Cash Flow: In terms of cash use, the company spent $3.1BN on PP&E, with the balance spent on debt paydowns ($3.8BN) as the company continued to strengthen its balance sheet, and dividends ($3.7BN , bringing the YTD total to $11.2BN).
  CapEx: A visual summary:  As shown in the following Y/Y bridge, a majority of the gains from Q3 2020 came from Upstream price increases, with chemical and downstream margin improvements contributing the balance:  Commentary and context: But perhaps what was the most surprising aspect of Exxon's release is the company's revival stock buybacks repurchases for the first time since 2016. The company said it plans to spend as much as $10 billion on repurchases starting next year. Following a surge in activist investor interest, Exxon and Chevron - the two largest U.S. oil and gas producers - are finally prioritizing shareholders rather than capital spending, despite energy crises in Europe and China and widespread concern about inflation and supplies of fossil fuels. The crucial question for executives at both companies when they appear on their respective conference calls with analysts later on Friday will be whether some of additional cash goes into boosting crude and gas production in 2022. 
 Exxon is expected to use the bulk of its extra cash flow to cover dividends and pay down debt, which peaked on a net basis at almost $70 billion at the end of 2020. All four of the company’s major rivals - Chevron, TotalEnergies SE, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc - are using this year’s commodity rally to buy back shares as well. Shell and BP were forced to cut their dividends last year. A big reason why both Exxon and Chevron oil generating record cash flow is because of deep budget cuts made during the pandemic-driven oil-market collapse of last year. Chevron’s year-to-date spending was 22% lower than the year-earlier period. But with record natural gas prices in Europe and Asia, and robust crude prices everywhere, there are growing incentives to increase investments in fossil fuels. Looking ahead, the company gave an optimistic preview of the fourth quarter, expecting solid improvement across its 3 key segments, as well as continued corporate ""streamlining""  And assuming $60 oil, the company expects earnings to hit $30BN by 2025, nearly triple the 2019 level, with cost-reductions expected to exceed $6BN by 2023 vs 2019.  Finally, with US oil E&Ps under the microscope of the net zero lobby, the company pledged $15BN in lower carbon investments from 2022 to 2027. Needless to say, this money is taken away from expanding its legacy business which is why the price of commodities will keep rising.  Following the solid earnings, and the surprise $10BN buyback announcement, the stock price jumped in the pre-market rising to its June highs, and is likely to continue its ascent higher as XOM's average rating is 'Hold', and the average sellside target price is just $68.52. Expect a burst of upgrades in the coming days. "
Oil To Close Month With 10 Gain Amid Energy Crunch.html,"Oil prices were set early on Friday to end the month of October with a 10-percent gain as the global energy crunch and rebounding demand have reduced inventories and tightened the oil market. As of 10:13 a.m. EDT on Friday, WTI Crude was down 0.62% at $82.34, and Brent Crude was down 0.09% to $84.31.   Prices started October at below $80 a barrel. But OPEC+ keeping supply tight, rebounding global demand, and the rally in other energy commodities have pushed prices to multi-year highs this month. By the middle of October, WTI Crude prices had already hit the highest level since October 2014 at $83.73, while the international benchmark had briefly jumped above $86 per barrel at $86.04, which was the highest price since October 2018. Tighter global oil supply and dwindling U.S. crude inventories sent Brent to a fresh three-year high of $86.10 per barrel on October 21.
 Early in October, OPEC+ supported oil prices after deciding to proceed with a 400,000 bpd increase in supply in November, despite calls from consuming nations—including the U.S.—to boost supply more. The natural gas crisis in Europe and record-high prices of LNG and coal in Asia have further driven oil prices higher in October. Meanwhile, industry stocks globally and in the United States have continued to draw down in recent weeks. Preliminary data compiled by the International Energy Agency (IEA) showed OECD industry stocks fell by 23 million barrels in September to stand 210 million barrels below their five-year average and at their lowest level since March 2015.
 U.S. commercial crude inventories have also been drawing for most of October, except for the latest reporting week to October 22, which showed an inventory build of 4.3 million barrels that put the brakes on the oil price rally.   Crude oil prices saw “a small two-day correction that quickly ran out steam given the focus on tight market conditions as consumption continues to outpace supply,” Saxo Bank’s strategy team said on Friday. “The tightness can be seen in the very elevated time spreads, especially in WTI where dwindling stocks at Cushing, the delivery hub for WTI, has resulted in a very elevated spot price relative to the following months,” the bank’s analysts added.   "
OPEC Now Sees Smaller Oil Market Deficit In Q4.html,"The OPEC+ group now expects the oil market to show a deficit of just 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the fourth quarter, down from initial expectations of a 1.1-million-bpd deficit, delegates told Bloomberg. The alliance’s Joint Technical Committee (JTC) significantly downgraded the expectations of a market deficit at their meeting on Thursday after reviewing the latest data on global oil demand, Bloomberg’s sources added. The technical panel monitors the situation on the market and meets ahead of every ministerial meeting of OPEC+. Ministers are scheduled to meet on November 4 to discuss how to proceed with the easing of the collective production cuts.
 The lower expected deficit would justify the continued cautious approach of the group in adding supply to the market. Since August, OPEC+ has been easing the cuts by 400,000 bpd in each month through November, despite calls from oil-consuming nations—including the United States—to boost supply and tame the oil price rally. The downgrade to the expected deficit would also justify the position of OPEC’s top producer and the world’s largest exporter that market participants should look beyond the fourth quarter of this year. OPEC+ needs to remain cautious with its approach to oil production adjustments despite rising prices, Saudi Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, told Bloomberg in an interview earlier this week.
 The Saudi minister noted that higher production is only justifiable when there is a clear purpose for it, which, according to him, was now absent as utilities switching from gas or coal to oil were doing on a very limited scale. The energy minister also said he expected a significant increase in combined OPEC+ oil supply by the end of next year, even without the hypothetical return of Venezuela or Iran to international markets. “We don’t take things for granted,” he told Bloomberg. “We still have Covid, there are still lockdowns,” and jet fuel supply remains constricted. “So, we’re not yet out of the box and we’re not out of the realm of Covid.”"
California Is Aggressively Pursuing A Future Without Oil.html,"Last week, California’s Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a 3,200-foot buffer zone between oil and gas wells and homes, schools, hospitals, and other populated areas across the whole of California. At present, around 5 million Californians live within 1 mile of an oil or gas well. This new rule would not apply to existing wells but would limit future well drilling. Other major oil producing states, such as Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Texas, have already introduced this type of legislation to ensure the health and safety of populations living in oil producing areas, but the California rule would be the most far-reaching should it go through. As the seventh largest oil producing state in the U.S., with an output of around 463,000 bpd of oil equivalent, and achieving approximately $90 million annually from offshore oil and gas leases, fighting against the industry that supports the state’s economic growth may come as a shock. However, this is just the most recent of several attempts by the state government to curb the power of Big Oil.  This comes just weeks after a major oil spill in the region prompted calls for an end to drilling. The oil spill of 126,000 gallons, or 3,000 barrels, covered an area of 13 square miles of the Pacific Ocean earlier this month, washing up on Huntington and Newport beaches and leaving dead fish, oil-covered birds and contaminated wetlands in its wake. Officials have suggested that California’s aging energy infrastructure was to blame, initially investigating a 41-year-old oil pipeline as the cause of the spill.  Oil spills and international encouragement to move away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives have led many environmental organisations and communities across California to put pressure on the local government to make a change. But Big Oil and state oil organisations, such as the Western States Petroleum Association and the State Building and Construction Trades Council, have long opposed several of California’s oil policies and are pushing back against environmental activists, insisting that oil revenues are vital for the state economy as well as for job provision.
 There is an ongoing battle between California’s oil industry and those who benefit from oil revenues and employment and environmental groups and the liberal left who want more environmentally friendly energy policies to be introduced, in line with President Biden’s climate aims. The state government must tread a thin line between the two sides, supporting one of its main revenue producing industries as well as appealing to its large Democrat demographic.  But Governor Newsom is not afraid to speak out against Big Oil when it comes to backing national aims for a ‘greener future’. Earlier this year, Newsom announced the aim to end oil drilling in California by 2045, starting by banning new fracking permits within three years. Newsom has approached the California Air Resources Board, the group that draws up state climate change policy, to support the development of a strategy to phase out oil and gas by 2045. Newsom tweeted of the move, “We aren’t waiting for a clean energy future to arrive - we’re taking big steps to get there. California will end fracking & is the first state to set a date to phase out all oil extraction. We are committed to a healthier future for CA families.” 
 This adds to California’s progressive track record for climate-friendly policy, with the state expecting to ban gasoline-powered cars by as early as 2035. Having relied almost entirely on oil and gas for state revenues in the past, California is now a hub for several successful industries including tech, renewable energy, and automotive manufacturing. For example, one of the state’s top exports is electric cars, with the government encouraging automakers to sell more electric work trucks and delivery vans as demand grows.  While a movement away from oil and gas in such a large producing state seems difficult, when you look at recent market trends, such as a 90 percent drop in permits for all types of oil drilling in the state in the first quarter of 2021, this seems increasingly viable. It seems we are already seeing the beginnings of a clear movement away from oil and gas in California, whether Big Oil wants to admit it or not.  As the Cop26 climate summit is taking place, with the participation of several major world powers, encouraging countries around the world to transition their energy dependence away from fossil fuels, California is responding. The aims of liberal, urban California are gaining traction to the detriment of the small-town populations that continue to rely on the oil and gas industry. Ultimately, California looks set to back President Biden all the way in his fight against climate change and movement away from non-renewable energy."
Why US Gulf Coast Crude Inventories Are Suddenly Jumping.html,"Oil inventories on the U.S. Gulf Coast have grown to the highest in about ten years, adding 20 million barrels since the beginning of the month. The increase is due to stronger export demand from Asia, directing more barrels to the export hubs along the Gulf Coast. However, the buildup is temporary, Bloomberg reports, as refiners begin to ramp up operations after the end of seasonal maintenance. The increase in oil supplies directed to the Gulf Coast for exports and for local processing seems to be one of the reasons behind the substantial decline in oil inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma—the delivery point for West Texas Intermediate contracts. In early October, Bloomberg reported inventories at Cushing had been drawn down by the most on a weekly basis in five years, dropping to the lowest since 2018.
 Meanwhile, Gulf Coast refiners continue to struggle to secure all the crude oil supply they need in the wake of a devastating hurricane season that cost the industry the loss of 30 million barrels in total supply. OPEC+ imports are also lower, Bloomberg reported earlier, and imports from Latin America are also lower. The inventory drawdown at Cushing served to push prices higher earlier this week as it indicated continued strong demand in the context of tight supply in the latest signal that oil markets are not perfectly balanced yet. However, prices retreated on news that Iran and the EU were planning to return to the nuclear deal negotiation table. This, to oil traders, means more oil may be coming to markets soon, although the successful completion of the talks is far from a certainty. ""As long as they are talking, there is a chance a deal gets done,"" Bob Yawger from Mizuho Securities told Bloomberg.
 Meanwhile, markets will remain volatile until OPEC+ interferes, according to another analyst. ""Only if OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) intervenes with more supply of crude or if COVID rears its ugly head again, curbing demand, this high volatility will come off,"" Mukesh Sahdev, head of downstream at Rystad Energy, told Reuters."
Is A Bidding War About To Begin For This Remarkable Oil Tech.html,
Oil Retreats On Rising US Crude Stockpiles Iranian Nuclear Talks.html,"Oil prices fell early on Thursday to their lowest level of the past two weeks, after U.S. commercial crude stocks rose more than expected and Iran said the nuclear talks would resume by the end of November. As of 8:51 a.m. EDT, WTI Crude was down 1.21% at $81.66, while Brent Crude traded down 1.09% at $83.66, after prices had risen for most of October together with a global spike in natural gas and coal prices. The EIA weekly inventory report from Wednesday halted the most recent rally, after the administration estimated a crude oil inventory build of 4.3 million barrels for the week to October 22. This compared with a modest draw of 400,000 barrels for the previous week and analyst expectations for a build of 1.65 million barrels. The large drop in stocks at Cushing raised some concerns about the inventories at the delivery hub for the WTI futures contract, where inventories are now sitting at a three-year low at just 27.3 million barrels. Overall, the EIA report was not constructive for oil prices. Nor was an announcement from Iran that the Islamic Republic and EU countries could resume the so-called nuclear talks by the end of November.
 “We agree to start negotiations before the end of November. Exact date would be announced in the course of the next week,” Ali Bagheri Kani, Iran’s top negotiator, tweeted on Wednesday. The talks between Iran and the global powers about the U.S. and Iran returning to the nuclear deal had stalled before the Iranian presidential election in the summer. The possibility of Iranian barrels returning to the market had some participants running for the exits late on Wednesday and early on Thursday. Even if talks result in a deal this time, it would take months for Iran to clear all the hurdles to resuming legitimate oil exports.
 Oil prices also suffered from a drop in gas prices in Europe on Thursday after Russian President Vladimir Putin told Gazprom’s CEO Alexei Miller that as soon as the Russian gas giant completes filling Russia’s underground storage by or on November 8, “I would like you to start consistent and planned work on increasing the amount of gas in your underground depots in Europe – in Austria and Germany,” per the English translation on the Kremlin website. “In addition, this will create a favourable situation, at any rate, a better situation in the European energy market in general,” Putin said."
Exxon Is By Far The Best Bet On Guyanas Offshore Oil Boom.html,"Global energy supermajor ExxonMobil is one of the few Western energy companies to invest in developing Guyana’s burgeoning oil industry. Since making the first high quality oil discovery during 2015 in the 6.6 million acre Stabroek Block, where Exxon is the operator and owns a 45% interest, the oil supermajor has experienced incredible success. By the end of 2020, when global oil companies were tightening their belts and learning to live in a sub-$50 per barrel world Exxon announced it was focusing capital spending on offshore Guyana. That decision is paying off in spades for the global energy supermajor. Guyana is shaping up to be South America’s and potentially the world’s hottest offshore drilling location. By October 2021, Exxon had announced its 23rd crude oil discovery in the Stabroek Block with the Cataback-1 well which came hot on the heels of September’s find at the Pinktail well. The latest discovery along with the spate of earlier high-quality oil discoveries in offshore Guyana saw Exxon upgrade its estimated recoverable petroleum resources in the Stabroek Block, from an earlier appraisal of more than eight billion barrels, to 10 billion barrels.  Aside from the considerable drilling success and exploration upside to be unlocked in the Stabroek Block, operations are proving to be highly profitable. Hess, which owns a 30% interest in Stabroek with the remaining 25% held by China’s CNOOC, stated in February 2020 that Liza Phase One, which in December 2020 achieved full production capacity of 120,000 barrels per day, has a low breakeven price of $35 per barrel.  That is expected to fall further to an industry low of $25 per barrel when the Liza Phase Two development comes online. The Liza Unity FPSO, which set sail from Singapore for Guyana in August 2021, is on schedule to commence operations during early 2022. The FPSO has installed production capacity of 220,000 barrels per day and will develop around 600 million barrels of crude oil in the Liza field. 
 Exxon is also developing the Payara oilfield in the Stabroek Block, located to the north of Liza one at a water depth of around 2,000 meters. The Payara field is expected to breakeven at $32 per barrel, highlighting the operations considerable profitability in an environment where Brent is selling for over $85 per barrel. It is anticipated that Payara will commence production during 2024 and have capacity to pump 220,000 barrels of crude oil per day. This means that by mid-2024 Exxon expects to be pumping around 560,000 barrels of crude oil from the Stabroek Block. More importantly, a combination of low breakeven prices for the oilfields in the Stabroek Block and a very favorable production sharing agreement with Guyana’s government, with a low royalty rate and the means to recover development costs, makes Guyana a highly profitable jurisdiction for Exxon. The energy supermajor plans to further expand its operations in the Stabroek Block targeting the Yellowtail field as the next, and fourth, development. This was Exxon’s 13th oil discovery in the block and the 5,622-meter Yellowtail-1 well which drilled into what the company classified as a new reservoir. The Yellowtail-2 well completed during the first half of 2020, which was the 17th oil discovery in the Stabroek Block, confirmed the presence of the oil-bearing sandstone reservoir identified by the Yellowtail-1 well. That project according to Exxon will include the nearby Redtail oilfield which was discovered with the drilling of the Redtail-1 well completed in September 2020. Exxon anticipates that by 2026 the Stabroek Block will be pumping more than 750,000 barrels of crude oil per day That solid development runway coupled with the Stabroek Block’s substantial exploration upside indicates that recoverable oil resources will keep growing to well beyond 10 billion barrels.  Stabroek is shaping up to be a crucial asset for Exxon not only because of the large volume of quality petroleum discoveries but also characteristics of the crude oil discovered and being produced. Exxon’s Liza grade crude oil has an API gravity of 32 degrees and sulfur content of 0.58%. That not only signifies that it is easier and cheaper to refine than heavy and super-heavy crude oil blends, which are typically found in onshore South America, but has a far lower carbon footprint than many other blends when extracted. Those characteristics are important in a world where governments are working feverishly to reduce their carbon footprints and keep global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. That has seen considerable pressure placed on global energy companies to become carbon neutral. After some resistance, Exxon committed to reducing the carbon footprint of its operations by developing, as part of its upstream operations, low carbon emitting sources of fossil fuels. The development of the Stabroek Block and the light sweet crude oil contained within its reservoirs forms an important part of that strategy. This is especially important to consider when it is accepted that oil and natural gas will remain important sources of energy even in a world where global warming is limited to less than 2 degrees Celsius.
 Guyana’s national government in Georgetown is focused on ensuring the deeply impoverished South American nation benefits from the vast petroleum wealth discovered by Exxon since 2015. This not only incudes in sharing in the profits generated by the Exxon led consortium developing the Stabroek Block but also building out infrastructure to supply energy to Guyana’s rapidly growing economy. Investment in petroleum production coupled with oil export revenues was responsible for gross domestic product expanding 43.5% during 2020, at a time when all other regional economies contracted because of the pandemic. The IMF expects Guyana’s economy to grow by an impressive 20% during 2021 as petroleum investment and production expands. Georgetown is seeking partners to build a 220-kilometer subsea natural gas pipeline connecting the Liza oilfield to an onshore natural gas processing facility and a gas-fired powerplant. Exxon has provided guarantees to Georgetown that the pipeline will be able to transport 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day from its Liza oilfield by 2024. That will reduce Exxon’s need to flare the natural gas produced by its Liza operations, which cost the supermajor $400 million in flaring fees earlier this year, thereby reducing the carbon footprint of the Liza field. As additional petroleum industry infrastructure is developed breakeven prices for energy projects in Guyana will fall, making it a highly profitable and hence attractive destination for foreign energy companies."
Alaskas Oil Renaissance Stumbles Despite Rise In Crude Prices.html,"As the United States slowly begins to recover from the economic low-point of the pandemic, some states are getting left behind. Jobs numbers are creeping up around the country, but five states -- Alaska, Hawaii, Wyoming, New Mexico and Louisiana -- have not yet recovered more than half of the jobs lost over the course of the pandemic according to a recent report from Fitch Ratings based on data gathered in August.  Notably, of these five states, Hawaii is the only one that doesn’t count oil and gas as a key part of its economy. The oil sector had a roller coaster ride during the development of the novel coronavirus pandemic, which took the bottom out of global oil demand in early 2020. This contraction was followed by a spat and then all-out oil price war waged between the leading OPEC+ members of Saudi Arabia and Russia. The ensuing oil glut maxed out global oil storage and pushed oil prices into the previously unthinkable negatives. On April 20, 2020 the West Texas Intermediate crude benchmark ended the day at nearly $40 below zero per barrel. Things have turned around, to say the least. At the time of writing, the West Texas Intermediate benchmark stood at $83.47 a barrel. In 2020 oil supplies were so high that owning oil was a liability. Today, Saudi Arabia is now warning that the world’s spare oil capacities are falling rapidly and has urged for greater investment in production. This has led to the addition of oil jobs in some areas. Texas added 2,900 oil exploration and production jobs in September alone.  Other oil sectors, however, continue to struggle. Alaska, and in particular the Alaskan oil industry, has been hit hard. In April, the International Energy Agency (IEA) announced that Alaskan oil production had hit a 40-year low. In-state oil jobs are at a 15-year low. “Most other trades have seen positive growth over the last year,” The Anchorage Daily news reported this week. “Still, the Alaska workforce remains 25,000 jobs below pre-pandemic levels.” 
 In one illustrative case in January of this year, Donald Trump opened up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to would-be oil drillers as one of his last actions before leaving office. But when the auction took place, almost no one showed up. While the last couple of years have been particularly hard for Alaskan oil, it’s likely that this winter is going to be even harder. “It’s going to be lean times, which affects the state in the long-term,” Dave Cruz, owner of oilfield services company Cruz Construction told the Anchorage Daily News. “People who have jobs out there should take care of them. There’s not much out there this winter.”  Industry insiders have projected that the delayed effect of rebounding oil demand and the current oil price rally will reach the Alaska job market sometime next year, but the prognosis is grim for the rest of 2021. Furthermore, there are a lot of factors that might keep Alaskan oil from ever rebounding to pre-pandemic levels -- which, it should be said, were already very low compared to the heyday of Alaskan oil.  Indeed, there is a whole lot standing in the way of an Alaskan oil renaissance. After oil companies slammed the brakes on Alaskan oil projects during the pandemic due to bottomed-out oil prices and concern for worker safety, starting back up is a slow process. Plus, Hilcorp bought out BP’s Alaska assets and, in doing so, left hundreds of workers behind. 
 And then there are all of the external factors. Previous drilling approvals handed down by the Trump administration have been walked back due to failure to comply with environmental standards. The Biden administration is trying to push forward a clean energy agenda which may not bode well for Alaskan oil drillers -- and the Democrats are far from alone in their distaste for drilling in the great white north. Nearly all of the major banks are completely divesting from drilling in the ecologically vulnerable Arctic.  The divestment trend is likely to continue. Around the globe, world leaders are starting to get serious about combating climate change. And, as we speak, tens of thousands of representatives from all corners of the globe are headed to Glasgow for the 26th annual United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), known as COP26, where they will work on furthering the global agenda to curb greenhouse gas emissions. No matter how that agenda develops, you can be sure that it won’t bode well for Alaskan oil. "
Pipeline Leak Disrupts Libyas Oil Exports.html,"Libya’s Es Sider pipeline has a major leak that will require a 7- 10-day shutdown for maintenance, NOC reported on Wednesday. The news comes on the back of Tuesday’s report on skirmishes by armed groups that “severely” damaged Libya’s Zawiya Oil Complex, Libya’s National Oil Corporation reported on Tuesday.  The Es Sider shutdown will take 200,000 bpd of Libyan shipments out of commission, said NOC’s media department, according to Reuters. NOC blamed the leak on the fact that there is still no budget, after the parliament earlier rejected the GNU’s proposal.
 Libya has been plagued with maintenance and security issues that have disrupted crude oil production, which have so far kept the OPEC producer from achieving its production goals. 13 petroleum products and crude oil storage tanks sustained damage on Tuesday, as well as an electrical transformer supplying power to the main station for oil mixing and filling. The NOC was still determining the full extent of Tuesday’s damage when Wednesday’s pipeline disruption was announced.
 “Such criminal acts cannot be accepted in or near our sites. Many of our facilities have been sabotaged during the past years as a result of clashes, but those damaged sites have been renovated and returned to work. It may take years to repair these new damages, and could cost the Libyan state an exponential amount of money, which is difficult to obtain,” Chairman of the NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, said on Tuesday, adding that “The infrastructure of the oil sector represents the lifeblood of the Libyan state. Therefore, vandalising these facilities, destroying them, or exposing their workers to danger, is a crime that cannot be tolerated. Therefore, we ask the respective authorities to extend their security in and around these sites, protect our workers, and provide security requirements to ensure we continue our operations there.”"
Crude Build Puts The Brakes On The Oil Price Rally.html,"Crude oil prices retreated today after the Energy Information Administration reported a build in U.S. crude inventories Gasoline and distillate stocks saw a small decline Crude oil imports came in slightly higher this week Crude oil prices retreated today after the Energy Information Administration reported an inventory build of 4.3 million barrels for the week to October 22. This compared with a modest draw of 400,000 barrels for the previous week and analyst expectations for a build of 1.65 million barrels. Gasoline stocks were down by 2 million barrels, the EIA also said, with production slightly up on the previous week. This compared with an inventory draw of 5.4 million barrels for the previous week, with production averaging 10.1 million bpd.
 In middle distillates, the agency estimated an inventory decline of 400,000 barrels for the week to October 22. Production of middle distillates averaged 4.6 million bpd. This compared with a middle distillate inventory decline of 3.9 million barrels a week earlier, and production of 4.4 million bpd. Refinery inputs averaged 15 million bpd last week, the EIA also said, an increase of 58,000 bpd on a week earlier. Imports of crude averaged 6.3 million bpd, compared with 5.8 million bpd a week earlier.
 Oil prices hit a seven-year high on Tuesday, driven up by continued robust demand in the United States and the tight global supply situation, which OPEC+ has signaled it will not alleviate for now with additional supply. The situation is expected to remain tense. ""The energy crunch is still nowhere close to subsiding, so we expect prevailing strength in oil prices in November and December as supply lags demand and as OPEC+ stays on the sidelines,"" Reuters quoted Louise Dickson from Rystad Energy as saying earlier this week. One other analyst from OANDA said it was possible that Brent crude would reach $90 per barrel by the end of the year. Earlier, Goldman Sachs, which had forecast Brent at $90, said the benchmark could even top that by the end of the year. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $85.56 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $83.87 per barrel, both down slightly from the end of trading on Tuesday."
OPEC Ready To Risk Higher Prices.html,"OPEC+ is ready to risk prices going higher and affecting demand rather than add more supply to curb the upward potential of benchmarks, Reuters’ John Kemp wrote in a column this week. According to Kemp, OPEC+, like U.S. shale oil drillers, tend to put more weight on the downside risks for prices than on upside risks. Indeed, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister Abdulaziz bin Salman earlier this week said OPEC+ was in no rush to boost production in response to calls for more barrels as the cartel didn’t take anything for granted. “We don’t take things for granted,” the official said. “We still have Covid, there are still lockdowns,” and jet fuel supply remains constricted. “So, we’re not yet out of the box and we’re not out of the realm of Covid.”
 His Nigerian counterpart echoed the sentiment in separate comments. “We have to look at the situation closely before we take action,” Timipre Sylva told Bloomberg in an interview. “It’s still very fragile. We must be very cautious before we take the next move.” “We’ve seen the slow down in China,” Sylva also said. “A lot of people are calling for more oil, but we’re looking at problems in some economies. We know that we haven’t completely opened up yet.” U.S. shale drillers, for their part, are focused on keeping shareholders happy even if prices are high enough to make most shale oil profitable. While smaller, private players are ramping up production, the big fish in the shale pond are still practicing restraint.
 Interestingly enough, Energy Aspects’ Amrita Sen suggested this week higher oil prices are actually to be embraced as enablers of the energy transition. In an opinion piece for the Financial Times, Sen argued that “higher prices are the most effective catalyst of changes in demand-side behaviour.” In other words, the longer fossil fuel prices stayed high, the more likely demand would start to shrink."
A Global Oil Shortage Is Inevitable.html,"Chronic underinvestment in new oil supply since the 2015 crisis and the pressure on oil and gas companies to curb emissions and even “keep it in the ground” will likely lead to peak global oil production earlier than previously expected, analysts say.  This would be a welcome development for green energy advocates, net-zero agendas, and the planet if it weren’t for one simple fact: oil demand is rebounding from the pandemic-driven slump and will set a new average annual record as soon as next year.   The energy transition and the various government plans for net-zero emissions have prompted analysts to forecast that peak oil demand would occur earlier than expected just a few years ago. However, as current investment trends in oil and gas stand, global oil supply could peak sooner than global oil demand, opening a supply gap that would lead to increased volatility on the oil market, with spikes in prices, and, potentially, structurally higher oil prices by the middle of this decade and beyond.  Supply Could Peak Before Demand “On current trends, global oil supply is likely to peak even earlier than demand,” Morgan Stanley’s research department wrote in a note this week carried by Reuters.   “The planet puts boundaries on the amount of carbon that can safely be emitted. Therefore, oil consumption needs to peak,” analysts at Morgan Stanley said. The problem with the world is that oil consumption - wishful thinking, investor pressure, and all - is not peaking. Nor will it peak until the end of this decade at the earliest, according to most estimates.  OPEC expects global oil demand to continue to grow into the mid-2030s to 108 million barrels per day (bpd), after which it is set to plateau until 2045, as per the cartel’s latest annual outlook.  Some other analysts expect peak demand at some point in the late 2020s.  
 Investment in new supply, however, is severely lagging global oil demand growth. Demand is growing again after the 2020 COVID crisis and, contrary to some expectations from early 2020 that the world’s oil consumption would never return to pre-pandemic levels, demand is currently just a few months away from hitting and exceeding those levels.  Supply Gap Is Looming In Just A Few Years Supply, on the other hand, looks constrained beyond the OPEC+ deal horizon.  New investment last year slumped to a decade-and-a-half low. Last year, global upstream investment sank to a 15-year low of $350 billion, according to estimates by Wood Mackenzie from earlier this year.  Investment is not expected to materially pick up this year, either, despite $80 oil. That’s because supermajors stick to capital discipline and pledge net-zero emission targets, part of which some of them plan to reach by curbing investment and developments in non-core little-profitable new oil projects.  U.S. shale, for its part, is not rushing this time to “drill themselves into oblivion,” as Harold Hamm said in 2017, as American producers look to finally reward shareholders after years of plowing cash flows into drilling and chasing production growth.  Considering that oil demand will still grow, at least for a few more years, underinvestment in new supply would be a major problem in the medium and long term.  Despite the energy transition, demand will not just vanish, and new supply will be needed for years to come to replace declining production and reserves.  The oil industry will need massive investments over the next 25 years in order to meet demand, according to OPEC. The industry will need cumulative long-term upstream, midstream, and downstream oil-related investments of $11.8 trillion by 2045, OPEC says.
 Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive at France’s TotalEnergies, said at the Energy Intelligence Forum this month that oil prices would “rocket to the roof” by 2030 if the industry were to stop investments in new supply, as some scenarios for net-zero by 2050 suggest. “If we stop investing in 2020, we leave all these resources in the ground ... and then the price will rocket to the roof. And even in developed countries, it will be a big issue,” Pouyanné said.  $100 Oil Is No Longer An Outrageous Prediction  A triple-digit oil price is no longer an outrageous prediction as it would have been in early 2020.   Francisco Blanch, global head of commodities and derivatives research at Bank of America, expects oil to hit $100 by September 2022, or even earlier if this winter is much colder than expected.  Demand is coming back, while we have seen severe underinvestment in supply the last 18 months, Blanch told Bloomberg at the end of September.    “The underinvestment problem cannot be solved easily, and at the same time we have surging demand,” he said.  “We are moving into a straightjacket for energy, we don’t want to use coal, we want to use less and less gas, we want to move away from oil,” Blanch told Bloomberg.  While oil is unlikely to sit at triple digits for a sustained period of time, underinvestment has become “a multi-year problem” for the industry, Blanch noted.  Even if oil doesn’t stay at $100 a barrel, a supply crunch down the road would nevertheless move the floor under oil prices higher and lead to unsustainable price spikes. As much as climate activists want a stop to investment in new supply, the industry and the world cannot afford it because oil demand continues to grow.  "
Money Managers Are Throwing Their Weight Behind The Oil Price Rally.html,
Aramco CEO Underinvestment In Oil Is A Huge Concern.html,"Crude oil production capacity is dwindling globally, and more investments in new production are needed urgently, Aramco's chief executive told Bloomberg. ""It's a huge concern,"" Amin Nasser said, adding that ""If there's aviation pick up next year, that spare capacity will be depleted. It's now getting to a situation where there's limited supply -- whatever is left that's spare is declining rapidly."" The International Energy Agency defines spare oil production capacity as production that can be started within 30 days and sustained for at least 90 days. Aramco is already working on boosting its spare capacity to 13 million bpd over the next five years.
 ""We maintain 25-year production profiles for new projects. Our philosophy is to provide cleaner oil and gas for the long term. We are developing it for the long term, not the short term,"" Amin Nasser said earlier this month at the Energy Intelligence Forum, where he announced the capacity boost plan. Bloomberg noted in its report that oil and gas traders have leveled criticism at governments and activist organizations for calling for an end to new oil and gas exploration, warning this would lead to an energy shortage during the next ten years. Over the immediate term, however, there is no danger of shortages. In fact, most expect the market to swing into a surplus next year of about 1 million bpd by March 2022. This would compare to a deficit of 1.5 million bpd at the moment.
 Just last week, a new report from the UN Environmental Program became the latest in a string of reports calling for the suspension of oil and gas drilling. According to one of the report's authors, ""global coal, oil, and gas production must start declining immediately and steeply to be consistent with limiting long-term warming to 1.5°C."" "
Saudi Oil Minister OPEC Shouldnt Rush To Boost Production.html,"OPEC+ needs to remain cautious with its approach to oil production adjustments despite rising prices, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister Abdulaziz bin Salman told Bloomberg in an interview. Bin Salman noted that higher production is only justifiable when there is a clear purpose for it, which, according to him, was now absent as utilities switching from gas or coal to oil were doing on a very limited scale. The energy minister also said he expected a significant increase in combined OPEC+ oil supply by the end of next year, even without the hypothetical return of Venezuela or Iran to international markets, bin Salman also said.
 “We don’t take things for granted,” the official said. “We still have Covid, there are still lockdowns,” and jet fuel supply remains constricted. “So, we’re not yet out of the box and we’re not out of the realm of Covid.” OPEC+ is adding 400,000 bpd to its combined output every month, but some members have found it difficult to boost production, and this has resulted in overcompliance with the voluntary cuts and continued tight supply. However, the cartel has so far resisted calls for a greater boost in output to catch up with demand. This weekend, Nigeria’s oil minister chimed in with his Saudi counterpart in saying the cartel should not rush into any production boosts as demand remained threatened by Covid flare-ups.
 “We have to look at the situation closely before we take action,” Timipre Sylva told Bloomberg in an interview in Riyad. “It’s still very fragile. We must be very cautious before we take the next move.” “We’ve seen the slow down in China,” the Nigerian official also said. “A lot of people are calling for more oil, but we’re looking at problems in some economies. We know that we haven’t completely opened up yet.”"
Oilfield Service Companies Cant Catch A Break.html,"Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’re probably well aware that oil and gas prices are skyrocketing around the United States and around the world. As the global economy bounces back from the novel coronavirus pandemic and demand for goods and services recovers to something like pre-pandemic levels, supply chains and nodes of production have been unable to keep up. Supply bottlenecks, shipping restrictions, and labor shortages have led to high costs for all kinds of economic sectors, but few have been hit as hard or as swiftly as the energy industry.  In Europe, an energy crunch is imperiling the European Union’s economy and energy security as well as the continent’s ability to meet its own emissions goals. This crisis is only set to ramp up as temperatures drop in the winter months, and just as representatives from all around the globe flock to Glasgow for the 26th annual United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), known as COP26, kicking off later this month. In China, supply crunches along with price caps on energy are leading energy companies to choose between bankruptcy or halting production altogether, as Beijing urges coal plants to produce as much as possible, climate pledges be damned. India, too, is facing severe supply crunches and is at severe risk of running out of coal (which accounts for a whopping 70% of the subcontinent’s energy mix) entirely.  In the United States, the energy crunch has not reached the crisis levels currently unfolding in the European Union and Asia, but the economy has proven to be far from immune to these global market pressures. Oil is currently trading at seven-year highs and the West Texas Intermediate Crude benchmark has surpassed $80 per barrel. And all that inflation is projected to keep increasing as oil gets more and more expensive to produce. Rystad Energy predicts that the cost of production in the Permian Basin will inflate by 10 to 15 percent in the coming year. While the entire economy is experiencing inflation, this blows overall inflation rates out of the water. 
 Related: Oil Prices Could Explode As U.S.' Largest Storage Hub Nears Empty Meanwhile, the oilfield services companies that are experiencing the brunt of the cost hikes have made it clear that they will be passing the buck along to producers. Oilfield services companies suffered mightily from the contraction of the oil market in 2020 when the pandemic drove oil prices to historic lows. With limited resources and downsized staff in a time that hiring seems impossible, companies like Halliburton will not be footing the bill for higher operational costs.  While operational costs are going to rise considerably for U.S. shale companies, however, oil prices are so high that they will still be making a tidy profit. According to reporting from the Financial Times, costs will likely rise from $50 a barrel to around $55 a barrel. At $80 a pop, it’s certainly still worth oil and gas companies’ while. Ultimately, it will be buyers and U.S. consumers who shoulder the burden of higher production costs. 
 The rising costs of fuel and energy, which will only continue to rise over the course of the winter as demand rises and the squeeze intensifies, threatens national and global economies’ post-Covid economic recoveries. As consumers are forced to pay more to utilities and more at the gas pumps, they will have fewer dollars to spread around other economic sectors.  And the potential damage of the energy crunch is far from limited to economic rebound. As hinted at above, it also poses a major threat to the world’s nascent green energy transition. As nations struggle to hold onto their energy security, climate pledges and emissions goals take a back seat to keeping the lights on. "
Putin Not All OPEC Producers Can Ramp Up Output Quickly.html,"Although the OPEC+ alliance is currently ramping up its collective crude oil production slightly above what they had agreed on, not all members of the group can quickly raise their output, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at an event on Thursday. “Currently, the OPEC+ countries are increasing production volumes, even slightly more than they agreed to do, but not everyone can do it,” Putin said at an economic discussion on Thursday, as carried by Russian news agency TASS. “Not all oil-producing countries are able to quickly increase oil production. This is a long-term process, a long cycle,” the Russian president added.
 The OPEC+ group, in which Russia is the key non-OPEC partner, decided earlier this month to proceed with increasing the coalition’s overall oil production by 400,000 bpd—the minimum the market was expecting. However, for several months now, some OPEC+ members—including OPEC’s Angola and Nigeria and non-OPEC’s Azerbaijan—have struggled to raise their oil production to the highest possible level allowed under the deal. The struggles have come from technical issues, a lack of investments, and lower exploration efforts in recent years. 
 OPEC+ saw its overall compliance with the collective oil production cuts at 115 percent in September, a delegate told Argus on Monday. The September compliance rate was down from the 116-percent compliance in August, but still higher than the market had hoped, with some members of the alliance failing to ramp up production in line with their quotas. The high compliance rate despite the monthly easing of the cuts by 400,000 bpd suggests that not all members of the pact are capable of raising supply as quickly as their quotas under the deal stipulate. According to Bloomberg’s estimates, if all members of the OPEC+ alliance stuck to their respective production ceilings in September, the overall production of the group would have been 747,000 bpd higher than what it was."
Canadas Oil Industry Is Facing Resistance On All Fronts.html,
Venezuelas Crumbling Oil Industry Is An Environmental Time Bomb.html,"Venezuela’s profound economic and humanitarian crisis fails to attract the headlines it once did, particularly after the U.S. recognized interim president Juan Gauido’s May 2019 uprising failed. While the autocratic Maduro regime’s actions continue to gain some media attention, it appears that the world’s worst modern economic collapse outside of war is no longer the breaking news it once was. This is despite the humanitarian crisis deepening to the point where nearly all Venezuelans live in poverty and the growing regional threat posed by terrorists as well as other non-state armed groups operating in Venezuela’s territory. What many international commentators are failing to acknowledge is the environmental time bomb created by Venezuela’s vast petroleum reserves, which at 304 billion barrels are by far the world’s largest. Two decades of mismanagement, malfeasance, and corruption coupled with ever harsher U.S. sanctions have caused Venezuela’s once-mighty oil industry, which saw the OPEC member become a leading world oil exporter, to implode. In the space of just over two decades, petroleum output has plunged from over three million barrels per day to an average of 527,000 barrels for September 2021, according to the latest OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report. That rapid disintegration is the result of chronic underinvestment in industry infrastructure and operations including regular maintenance as well as overhaul operations. Aside from profoundly impacting Venezuela’s petroleum production the heavily corroded state of the OPEC member’s energy infrastructure means that hydrocarbon emissions and oil spills are becoming an everyday occurrence. A recent Reuters article estimated there were 53 oil spills in Venezuela from January to 30 September 2021, which is a stunning number for a country only pumping around half a million barrels daily. In comparison, the world’s largest oil producer, the U.S., which according to the U.S. EIA is pumping an average of 11,300 barrels per day or 21 times greater than Venezuela’s petroleum output experienced an estimated 131 spills for the same period. The authoritarian Maduro regime’s unwillingness to collate and make petroleum industry data publicly available, including environmental incidents, makes it extremely difficult to track the full extent of the problem. For that reason, it is likely that the volume of oil spills is far greater than those being recorded by non-government environmental and industry bodies. Most of the recorded oil spills for 2021 have occurred on the Caribbean coast where Venezuela’s refining infrastructure is located. Ramshackle refineries and heavily corroded feedstock pipelines pump oil, hydrocarbon debris, and fumes into the environment every time aging distilling and other processing units are activated. Falcon state is a prime location for oil spills in Venezuela. The state contains a significant portion of the OPEC member’s refining capacity including the Paraguaná refinery complex, which with a nameplate capacity of 940,000 barrels daily is classified as the world’s third-largest complex. Most, if not all, of Venezuela’s petroleum processing infrastructure, is decrepit and heavily corroded making it an environmental time bomb. One of the worst reported spills this year, by Venezuelan newspaper La Prensa de Tachira (Spanish), occurred in Falcon State at the Paraguaná Refining Complex. A Cardon Refinery gasoline holding tank developed a crack in its base seeing it spill 3.6 million liters of gasoline into the surrounding Gulf of Venezuela marine environment causing severe damage. The facility in question, reportedly, had not undergone any maintenance since 2016 despite requiring two-year reviews. Then in October 2021 another spill at the Paraguaná facility was identified. This was caused by a ruptured underwater hydrocarbon pipeline that pumped crude oil into the sea for 10 days before being sealed in early October 2021.
 Venezuela’s chronically troubled 140,000 barrel El Palito Refinery, in Carabobo State, suffered a major spill last year pumping 26,730 barrels of crude oil into the Caribbean Sea in August 2020 after a troubled restart following an overhaul by Iranian technicians. During the facility’s reactivation, a leaking catalytic cracker forced PDVSA to implement emergency shutdown protocols because of the risk of an explosion. This led to questions over the quality of the work conducted by Teheran’s technicians and why Caracas had paid for the work by transferring gold to Iran. Since September 2021 Caracas has been pushing to restart the facility in a bid to ease Venezuela’s crippling gasoline shortages, ratcheting up the risk of yet another oil spill in the region. Related: Why Iraq Can, But Won’t, Reach 8 Million Bpd Of Oil Production Lake Maracaibo, the largest lake in South America which is connected to the Gulf of Venezuela by a narrow strait, is so heavily polluted that oil slicks and algae blooms regularly occur. NASA satellite imagery from 25 September 2021 shows a series of slicks and algae blooms on the surface of the lake’s waters. According to local communities Lake Maracaibo’s shores are covered in a film crude oil. The severity of the pollution has devastated fish stocks and other wildlife, destroying the local fishing industry one of the few livelihoods left to Venezuelans after the petrostate’s economic implosion. Caracas and PDVSA rarely if ever undertake clean-up efforts, leaving the crude oil in situ to continue causing environmental damage. It is for that reason the damage to Lake Maracaibo, which for over a century has been the focal point of Venezuela’s petroleum industry, is so severe.
 A key part of resurrecting Venezuela’s petroleum industry is conducting urgently required maintenance and overhauls on severely corroded industry infrastructure including vital pipelines as well as refineries. While Caracas has arranged deals with China and Iran for the skilled technicians, parts, and labor required to repair derelict energy sector infrastructure there has been little progress, explaining why Venezuela’s oil production is in decline. Much of Venezuela’s oil infrastructure is so decrepit that it cannot be repaired with major overhauls or new facilities required. That will take large sums of capital which, to date, Teheran and Beijing have shown they are incapable or reluctant to provide. The only way Venezuela will be able to generate the vast sums of capital, estimated to be as much as $220 billion, is by attracting investment from Western Energy majors which will not occur until Washington eases sanctions. Until that occurs there will be little to no capital available to a near-bankrupt Caracas nor PDVSA to perform urgent maintenance and overhauls of pipelines, refineries, and other infrastructure. For that reason, oil spills and other accidents leading to the release of damaging hydrocarbons into the environment will remain a persistent problem which is further exacerbated by Caracas’ inability to undertake even basic clean-ups."
Oil Rebounds On Surprise Crude Inventory Draw.html,"A week after it reported a sizeable oil inventory build that pushed prices lower for a while, the EIA today said crude oil had last week shed 400,000 barrels. At 426.5 million barrels, inventories remain below the five-year average for this time of the year. Gasoline inventories were down last week, by a sizeable 5.4 million barrels. This compared with a draw of 2 million barrels for the previous week. Gasoline production last week averaged 10.1 million bpd, which compared with 9.6 million bpd a week earlier.
 In middle distillates, the EIA estimated an inventory decline of 3.9 million barrels. This compared with a flat week-on-week inventory situation for the seven days to October 8. Middle distillate production averaged 4.4 million bpd last week. This compared with 4.7 million bpd for the previous week. Meanwhile, the now global energy crunch continued to support prices. Since the start of September, Brent crude has gained almost 20 percent, according to Reuters, while West Texas Intermediate has added 21 percent. ""Supply-demand balances show that the market is experiencing a supply deficit, which is spurring deep inventory draws and driving prices upwards,"" Louise Dickson, senior oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy, told Reuters.
 ""This market tightness is expected to extend into most of 2022, and crude oil supply will only catch up with crude demand by the fourth quarter of next year."" This has prompted a revision of peak oil demand forecasts, with the International Energy Agency earlier this month warning more investment in new oil production was necessary to avoid more energy crunches. This week, a drop in temperatures in China added fuel to the oil price rally, as the first sign of a coming test of the country’s preparedness for winter. China has been gobbling up coal, oil, and gas in anticipation of the cold season, moving all fossil fuel prices higher. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $84.09 a barrel, with WTI at $82.02 a barrel."
Excitement Builds As Big Oil Prepares To Release Earnings.html,"Third-quarter 2021 earnings season is about to hit high gear, with 72 S&P 500 companies set to report this week. Among them are four energy companies, namely NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), NextEra Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: NEP), Schlumberger N.V. (NYSE:SLB), and Halliburton Co. (NYSE:HAL). The energy sector posted stellar earnings during the first half of the year, and the third quarter is expected to continue this trend thanks to huge improvements in commodity prices. The sector reported Q2 2021 earnings of $13.9 billion compared to a loss of -$10.6 billion in Q2 2020, thanks to vast improvements in commodity prices especially crude, which averaged $66.17/bbl in Q2 2021 compared to $28/bbl in Q2 2020 and $61/bbl in Q1 2021. American oil and gas supermajors ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were the largest contributors to the improved earnings for the sector, with the two companies accounting for $13.3 billion of the $24.6 billion year-over-year increase in earnings for the sector. The oil and gas rally continued throughout the third quarter, meaning even better margins and cash flows. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, WTI crude prices averaged $72.49 in July, $67.73 in August, and $71.65 in September this year compared to $40.71, $42.34, and $39.63 in the months of July, August, and September of 2020, respectively. The natural gas front has been even more impressive: In Q3 of 2020, U.S. Henry Hub average natural gas prices were $3,84, $4.07, and $5.16 per MMBtu, in July, August, and September 2021 compared to $1.77 per MMBtu, $2.30, and $1.92 in July, August and September 2020, respectively.  Source: Y-Charts Yet another reason why earnings could impress: Less oil and gas hedging. Rystad Energy says the U.S. shale industry is on course to set a significant milestone in 2021: Record pre-hedge revenues. According to the Norwegian energy navel-gazer, U.S. shale producers can expect a record-high hydrocarbon revenue of $195 billion before factoring in hedges in 2021 if WTI futures continue their strong run and average at $60 per barrel this year and natural gas and NGL prices remain steady. The previous record for pre-hedge revenues was $191 billion set in 2019. Rystad says hedging losses might not be that high because producers are not so keen on using them this time around.
 Shale companies typically increase production and add to hedges when oil prices rally, in a bid to lock in profits. However, the mad post-pandemic rally has left many wondering whether this can really last and led to many firms backing off from hedging. Indeed, 53 oil producers tracked by Wood Mackenzie have only hedged 32% of expected 2021 production volumes, considerably less than the same time a year ago. Here's a rundown of what to expect when the oil and gas supermajors report third-quarter earnings. #1. ExxonMobil North America's largest oil and gas company, ExxonMobil Corp.(NYSE:XOM), is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on October 29. Wall Street has a consensus EPS forecast of $1.51 for the company, a huge jump compared to last year's $-0.18. Exxon is expected to report revenue of $75.2B vs. $46.01B for last year's corresponding quarter. Sentiment around the company has remained positive and helped XOM shares jump 51.8% in the year-to-date. The shares have been trending upward after the company reported preliminary Q3 estimates. In the report, XOM announced that higher natural gas prices could improve Q3 earnings by $500M-900M over Q2 levels, while higher oil prices could lift profits by $200M-600M. Two weeks ago, the company raised its estimate of the discovered recoverable resource at the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana, including a new discovery at the Cataback-1 well, to ~10B boe. Exxon owns a 45% stake in the block; Hess (NYSE:HES) holds 30%, while CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) lays claim to 25%. #2. Chevron Exxon's close peer, Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX), is expected to report earnings on October 29 before market open. Chevron has a consensus EPS forecast for the quarter of $2.20, with reported EPS for the same quarter last year being $0.11. Q3 revenue is expected to clock in at $40.18B vs. $24B a year ago. Chevron Chairman and CEO Michael Wirth recently expressed optimism about the oil price trajectory, saying that he sees ""a fair amount of support"" after prices spiked above $80 a barrel in recent weeks. Wirth noted that oil prices have been making strong gains in a seasonally weak October period, which normally sees a lull in demand. ""The fact that we've seen prices actually strengthen at a time when they typically weaken, suggests that there's a fair amount of support in the market,"" he said. 
 For the long-term outlook, Wirth noted that the rising demand for green energy has made it more difficult to develop new supplies of oil and also increased pressure on companies to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks rather than spending it on new exploration and drilling. #3. ConocoPhillips ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is expected to report third-quarter earnings on the 2nd of November 2021 before market open.   COP has a consensus EPS forecast of $1.46, a huge improvement over $-0.31 reported for last year's corresponding period, while revenue is expected to clock in at $10.81B vs. $4.38B for last year's period. COP has beat earnings estimates for three straight quarters. A couple of months ago, Bank of America upgraded COP shares to Buy from Neutral with a $67 price target, calling the company a ""cash machine"" with the potential for accelerated returns. According to BofA analyst Doug Leggate, Conoco looks ""poised to accelerate cash returns at an earlier and more significant pace than any 'pure-play' E&P or oil major.""  Leggate COP shares have pulled back to more attractive levels ""but with a different macro outlook from when [Brent] oil peaked close to $70."" But best of all, the BofA analyst believes COP is highly exposed to a longer-term oil recovery. But BofA is not the only Wall Street punter that's gushing about COP. In a note to clients, Raymond James says the company's stock price is undervaluing the flood of cash the oil and gas company is poised to generate. A month ago, COP hiked its dividend by 7% to $0.46 per share. The shares currently yield 2.47%, suggesting there's plenty of room for further increases. Earnings and revenue estimates for the other four members of the seven oil and gas supermajors are as follows"
Biden Administration Begs OPEC For More Oil.html,"The Biden administration is not giving up on its attempts to convince OPEC that it needs to pump more oil as retail fuel prices remain uncomfortably high across the United States. “We are continuing to press, through member countries — member countries of OPEC, even as we are not a member — to address the supply issue and work to address it here as well,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki said during a briefing at the White House. “I would also note that what we’re also working to address is more of a logistics issue of how we are moving supply around the country, which means there are shortages in some places and not others, and that’s something that we are also working to address,” Psaki also said.
 “We are certainly well aware of the impact on any increase in gasoline prices or any costs on the American people, and we’re going to use — continue to use every lever at our disposal,” the press secretary added. There’s growing disgruntlement among American motorists from rising prices even as local oil production rises. Meanwhile, imports of crude are falling, according to EIA data.
 Earlier this month, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm suggested that the administration might release some crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to put a lid on prices. But later, the department walked back the comments. OPEC+, meanwhile, is failing to stick to its own production quotas as some members are struggling with years of underinvestment and insufficient exploration, Bloomberg reported this week. It has been a while since the U.S. first approached OPEC+ for more oil, but so far, the cartel has refused to help bring prices at the pump down. There are OPEC members with spare capacity to utilize but it seems as a whole the group has chosen the cautious approach to ramping up production, which means retail fuel prices might remain elevated for at least the next OPEC+ meeting, on November 4."
Permian Oil Output Close To Pre Pandemic Level.html,"Crude oil production in the Permian has climbed closer to pre-pandemic levels, according to the latest drilling productivity report of the Energy Information Administration. According to the report, oil production in the Permian stood at 4.826 million bpd this month and will rise to 4.888 million bpd in November. The October average is already higher than the average for February 2020, which stood at 4.816 million bpd. With the price of U.S. crude at over $80 per barrel for the first time in years, shale oil production is finally picking up. Although large public companies are still reluctant to boost output in any significant way lest they anger their cash-return-eager shareholders, smaller, private producers are ramping up to take advantage of the higher prices.
 “It’s a win for the privates without being a loss for the oil markets,” Raoul LeBlanc, an analyst at IHS Markit, told Bloomberg earlier this month. “The big takeaway is that private growth won’t ruin the party.” The recovery in the Permian will push total U.S. oil production higher as well. OPEC expects the U.S. to add some 800,000 bpd to global production, although “uncertainty regarding the financial and operational aspects of US production remains high,” the cartel said in its monthly report last week.  The EIA currently sees U.S. oil production averaging 11.0 million bpd this year, and rising to 11.7 million bpd in 2022. That’s 700,000 bpd growth on average for next year. 
 Overall, America’s production growth next year is expected to be modest, especially compared to the surges in output in 2018 and 2019, which led to a record U.S. oil production of 13 million bpd in February 2020, just before the pandemic crippled demand and crashed oil prices.  Currently, West Texas Intermediate is trading above $82 per barrel and Brent crude earlier this month topped $85 per barrel."
OPEC Under Produces Quota Despite Calls For More Oil.html,"The OPEC+ group saw its overall compliance with the collective oil production cuts at 115 percent in September, a delegate told Argus on Monday, down from the 116-percent compliance in August, but still higher than the market had hoped, with some members of the alliance failing to ramp up production in line with their quotas. The high compliance rate despite the monthly easing of the cuts by 400,000 bpd from the OPEC+ group suggests that not all members of the pact are capable of raising supply as quickly as their quotas under the deal stipulate. According to Bloomberg’s estimates, if all members of the OPEC+ alliance stuck to their respective production ceilings in September, the overall production of the group would have been 747,000 barrels per day (bpd) higher than what it was.
 OPEC+ was pumping 15 percent less crude oil than its overall production quota for September, delegates familiar with the output numbers told Bloomberg on Monday. For several months now, some OPEC+ members—including OPEC’s Angola and Nigeria and non-OPEC’s Azerbaijan—have struggled to raise their oil production to the highest possible level allowed under the deal. The struggles have come from technical issues, a lack of investments, and lower exploration efforts in recent years. The 115-percent estimated compliance of the OPEC+ producers in September is just a preliminary figure, which will be reviewed and amended if necessary by the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) in early November, before the monthly OPEC+ meeting of the ministers on November 4.
 For November, the required crude oil production from OPEC and its non-OPEC allies led by Russia is 39.694 million bpd, after OPEC+ decided to stick to the plan to ease the collective cuts by 400,000 bpd next month. If the OPEC+ group continues to under-produce compared to its overall quota, it could leave the oil market tighter than previously forecast. "
How Much Oil Can OPEC Realistically Add.html,"Two weeks ago, in a short and terse affair that did nothing to address the spill-over from overheating gas markets, OPEC+ confirmed that it would stick to its July agreement to boost output by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) each month until at least April 2022 to phase out 5.8 million bpd of existing production cuts. The group agreed in July to boost output by 400,000 bpd a month until at least April 2022 to phase out 5.8 million bpd of existing production cuts–already much lower compared to the huge curbs that were in place during the worst of the pandemic. The organization has lately come under pressure to ramp up production at a faster clip from several quarters, including the Biden administration so as to ease supply shortages and rein in spiraling oil prices. OPEC+ is scared of spoiling the oil price party by making any sudden or big moves with last year's oil price collapse still fresh on its mind. But maybe we have been overestimating how much power the cartel has to jack up production on the fly. According to a recent report, at the moment, just a handful of OPEC members are capable of meeting higher production quotas compared to their current clips. Amrita Sen of Energy Aspects has told Reuters that only Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iraq, and Azerbaijan are in a position to boost their production to meet set OPEC quotas, while the other eight members are likely to struggle due to sharp declines in production and years of underinvestment. Underinvestments stalling recovery According to the report, Africa's oil giants Nigeria and Angola are the hardest hit, with the pair having pumped an average of 276kbpd below their quotas for more than a year now. The two nations have a combined OPEC quota of 2.83 million bpd according to Refinitiv data, but Nigeria has failed to meet its quota since July last year and Angola since September 2020. In Nigeria, five onshore export terminals run by oil majors with an average production clip of 900,000 bpd handled 20% less oil in July than the same time last year despite relaxed quotas. The declines are due to lower production from all the onshore fields that feed the five terminals. 
 In fact, only French oil major TotalEnergies'(NYSE:TTE) new deep offshore oilfield and export terminal Egina has been able to quickly ramp up production. Turning the taps back on has been proving to be a bigger challenge than earlier thought due to a shortage of workers, huge maintenance backlogs, and tight cash flows. Indeed, it could take at least two quarters before most companies can work through their maintenance backlogs which covers everything from servicing wells to replacing valves, pumps, and pipeline sections. Many companies have also fallen behind on plans to do supplementary drilling to keep production stable.  Angola has not been faring any better. In June, Angola's oil minister, Diamantino Azevedo, lowered its targeted oil output for 2021 to 1.19 million bpd, citing production declines at mature fields, drilling delays due to COVID-19 and ""technical and financial challenges"" in deepwater oil exploration. That's nearly 11% below its 1.33 million bpd OPEC quota and a far cry from its record peak above 1.8 million bpd in 2008. The southern African nation has struggled for years as its oil fields steadily declined while exploration and drilling budgets failed to keep up. Angola's largest fields began production about two decades ago, and many are now past their peaks. Two years ago, the country adopted a string of reforms aimed at boosting exploration, including allowing companies to produce from marginal fields adjacent to those they already operate. Unfortunately, the pandemic has stunted the impact of those reforms, and not a single drilling rig was operational in the country by May, the first time this has happened in 40 years. So far, just three offshore rigs have resumed work. Shale decline But it's not just OPEC producers that are struggling to boost oil production. In an excellent op/ed, vice chairman of IHS Markit Dan Yergin observes that it's almost inevitable that shale output will go in reverse and decline thanks to drastic cutbacks in investment and only later recover at a slow pace. Shale oil wells decline at an exceptionally fast clip and therefore require constant drilling to replenish lost supply.  Indeed, Norway-based energy consultancy Rystad Energy recently warned that Big Oil could see its proven reserves run out in less than 15 years, thanks to produced volumes not being fully replaced with new discoveries. According to Rystad, proven oil and gas reserves by the so-called Big Oil companies, namely ExxonMobil, BP Plc. (NYSE:BP), Shell (NYSE:RDS.A), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Total (NYSE:TOT), and Eni S.p.A (NYSE:E) are all falling, as produced volumes are not being fully replaced with new discoveries.
 Granted, this is more of a long-term problem whose effects might not be felt soon. However, with the rising sentiment against oil and gas investments, it's going to be hard to change this trend. Experts are warning that the fossil fuel sector could remain depressed thanks to a big nemesis: the trillion-dollar ESG megatrend. There's growing evidence that companies with low ESG scores are paying the price and increasingly being shunned by the investing community. According to Morningstar research, ESG investments hit a record $1.65 trillion in 2020, with the world's largest fund manager, BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK), with  $9 trillion in assets under management (AUM), throwing its weight behind ESG and oil and gas divestitures. Michael Shaoul, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marketfield Asset Management, has told Bloomberg TV that ESG is largely responsible for lagging oil and gas investments: ""Energy equities are nowhere close to where they were in 2014 when crude oil prices were at current levels. There are a couple very good reasons for that. One is it's been a terrible place to be for a decade. And the other reason is the ESG pressures that a lot of institutional managers are on lead them to want to underplay investment in a lot of these areas."" In fact, U.S. shale companies are now facing a real dilemma after disavowing new drilling and prioritizing dividends and debt paydowns, yet their inventory of productive wells continues falling off a cliff. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the United States had 5,957 drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs) in July 2021, the lowest for any month since November 2017 from nearly 8,900 at its 2019 peak. At this rate, shale producers will have to sharply ramp up the drilling of new wells just to maintain the current production clip. If we need any more proof that shale drillers are sticking to their newfound psychology of discipline, there is recent data from the EIA. That data shows a sharp decline in DUCs in most major U.S. onshore oil-producing regions. This, in turn, points to more well completions but less new well drilling activity. It's true that higher completion rates have been leading to an uptick in oil production, particularly in the Permian; however, those completions have sharply lowered DUC inventories, which could limit oil production growth in the United States in the coming months. That also means that spending will have to increase if we are to see shale keep pace with production declines. More will have to come online, and that means more money."
China Once Again Cuts Oil Import Quotas For Indepedent Refiners.html,"Beijing has cut the crude oil import quotas for independent refiners for the rest of the year in the latest move to curb their growing oil market clout, Reuters has reported, citing industry sources. According to the report, the latest crude import quotas for independents is 14.89 million tons. This brings the total for the year to 177.14 million tons, which compares with 184.55 million tons for 2020. This would normally be strongly bearish news for oil. But there is so much going on for the bulls it's likely that the effect of what amounts to a future decline in Chinese oil imports will be temporary.
 A total of 16 independent refiners were granted import quotas, with the largest awarded to Hengli Petrochemical. However, the largest private refinery operator, Zhejiang Petrochemical Co, was not granted an import quota for its 800,000-bpd facility. China's crude oil imports over the first nine months of the year fell by 6.8 percent from the same period of 2020, with September imports alone dropping by more than 15 percent from a year earlier. Beijing's crackdown on the private refining industry was one reason behind this import decline as the government tackled excessive fuel supply, much of which came from teapots. Allegations of environmental law violations and tax evasion were also leveled against some independent refiners. Additionally, Beijing ordered state-owned refiners to stop trading their import quotas with private peers.
 As it tackles teapots, however, Beijing is having trouble securing enough energy supplies for the winter amid soaring gas and coal prices. Orders for boosting domestic coal production have been issued, and China is also ramping up its gas supplies. It is also changing its list of priorities, with decarbonization getting trumped by energy security. ""Energy security should be the premise on which a modern energy system is built, and the capacity for energy self-supply should be enhanced,"" Premier Li Keqiang said in a statement earlier this week."
Saudi Arabia Patience Is A Virtue In Oil Markets.html,"“Is it not time to add more barrels than OPEC is already providing?” was the question posed to HRH Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman by journalist Ryan Chilcote at Russian Energy Week. But his answer offered the energy markets a much bigger message. Balance is Coming While he didn’t answer yes or no, his response certainly suggested that whatever OPEC+ was doing is precisely what it will continue to do. “By end of this year, we will be at balanced stocks,” Prince Abdulaziz assured the forum, adding that the long game is what the market should be eyeing.   “We should look way beyond the tip of our noses. Because if you do, and take ’22 into account, you will end up by end of ’22 with a huge amount of overstocks.” The message here is clear. Balance to the oil markets is coming, even though OPEC isn’t going to add more barrels right now. OPEC is playing the long game - and if they add too many barrels in now, the market will again be oversupplied next year. So don’t hold your breath waiting for OPEC to give into U.S. pleas to turn on the taps - more than promised, that is - to bring down prices. OPEC+ is staying the course. Rest assured, OPEC+ has already agreed to lift production again in November, December, January, and February - by another 400,000 bpd each month, HRH added. And OPEC+ has already increased its production quota by 400,000 bpd in September and October. But while the group has lifted actual production in response to these new figures, the overall production by the group has failed to meet the full allotted volumes. Nevertheless, the increased production, should OPEC+ produce the full amount according to its plan, would be more than a million barrels per day on average between now and the end of February. “We struck that agreement because we believe it would create a balance by this end of the year,” Abdulaziz said.
 Yes, OPEC Has Spare Capacity Setting aside the definition of spare capacity for a moment, which varies based on how long one thinks it should take a producer to ramp up production, the Saudi Prince confirmed that OPEC+ has spare capacity. “...we want to make sure that we reduce these excess capacities that we have developed as a result of and the Covid and the consequences of Covid. We want to do it in a gradual, phased-in approach. And we believe we will have a challenging year in ’22 if we don’t attend to the situation remarkably with the same resolution.” Some analysts would argue that OPEC+’s failure to ramp up production over the last couple of months as promised indicates that not all OPEC+ members have the spare capacity that they used to. The IEA, which defines spare capacity as capacity that can be tapped within 90 days, estimates that as of the beginning of 2021, the spare capacity of OPEC+ totaled 9 million bpd. But production problems in Nigeria and Libya, sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, and more than a year of trimmed production in Russia and Saudi Arabia are eating into that spare capacity - or at best, rendering some of that spare capacity immediately untappable.  The EIA, on the other hand, defines spare capacity as that which can start up within 30 days. It is these differing definitions of “spare” that cause the market to worry that excess capacity won’t be there when the market calls for it. Spare capacity is where the market power really is. Promising spare capacity is promising the market that you have the power to ramp production up to meet demand and keep prices at ideal levels. Climate Change is Real And Trumps… Energy Security A message about climate change was also touched on: it is an issue that is even more important than energy security - a rather bold statement given today’s unsettled energy markets in the midst of shortages. “While we try to address energy security, we also should be mindful of the challenges and mitigation of a more important issue also, which is climate change. We believe solidly as OPEC does, that our job is to ensure the energy security when it comes to oil. But it takes a diversity of sources of energy for any of us to do that. Yet, we could also work with the other challenge, which is climate change.” Long Live OPEC+
 Russian President Vladimir Putin just days ago suggested that its deal with OPEC could continue beyond 2022. And now, the Prince is backing up that claim in his referring to Russia’s Alexander Novak as his “nearest and dearest” friend, adding that “energy markets need attendants, and needs a collaborate work.” The concept of an ongoing collaboration between two oil-producing titans is a critical component affecting oil prices. With the U.S. now benched as a swing producer, Saudi Arabia and Russia are currently in the driver’s seat regarding price setting. As such, any hint that the duo is headed for a breakup could send prices plummeting. It Could Be Worse Russian Energy Week also gave the Saudi Prince a chance to pat himself and the rest of OPEC on the back for a job well done. According to HRH, OPEC has done a great job balancing supply and demand. Referring to climate change and energy security in tandem, HRH argued that it shouldn’t be a zero-sum game.  “I think there are ways forward - solutions forward - that enable us to address both, but address both comprehensively.” Oil prices might be high - an “incremental increase of 29%” according to HRH, but that pales in comparison to the “500% increases” in gas prices or “300% increases in coal prices,” and “200% increases in NGLs”. OPEC is the Energy Regulator HRH sees OPEC as being in charge of the oil markets. It is not just a swing producer but a “regulator.” “If these markets [gas, coal, NGL], if these industries were attended to as what we have done immaculately [sic] in OPEC+ - clearly we have a lot to congratulate ourself with… we have done a remarkable job of being the so-called regulator of energy markets.”"
OPEC Cuts 2021 Oil Demand Forecast.html,"OPEC expects this year’s global oil demand to grow by 5.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from the low 2020 levels, down from last month’s estimate of 5.96-million-bpd annual growth. In its closely watched Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) on Wednesday, the cartel kept its 2022 oil demand growth forecast unchanged at 4.2 million bpd to average total global demand of 100.8 million bpd next year. Last month, OPEC had raised its 2022 oil demand forecast by 900,000 bpd, expecting the surge of the Delta variant to partially delay the oil demand recovery into the next year with robust economic growth and stronger recovery in fuel consumption. In this month’s report, OPEC revised downward its 2021 estimate due to lower-than-expected actual data for the first three quarters of the year and “despite healthy oil demand assumptions going into the final quarter of the year.”
 Global oil demand in the fourth quarter will be driven by a seasonal increase in petrochemical and heating fuel demand, as well as the potential switch from natural gas to petroleum products due to the high gas prices, the cartel noted. In recent weeks, there has been growing interest in switching from gas to oil, and “Should this trend continue, fuels such as fuel oil, diesel, and naphtha could see support, driven by higher demand from power generation, refining and petrochemical use,” OPEC said.  If Q4 is colder than average, heating oil markets could be supported, especially in December 2021, but this boost to demand could be offset by lower gasoline consumption, said OPEC.
 “Looking ahead, despite expectations of a seasonal pick-up in heating oil demand, as well as a potential switch from natural gas to liquid fuels, product markets are expected to see some weakness during the coming winter due to higher refinery throughput leading to ample supply,” the cartel noted. The slight downgrade to 2021 global oil demand, however, didn’t result in any downgrade for 2022 demand, which OPEC still sees as “supported by healthy economic momentum in the main consuming countries and better management of the COVID-19 pandemic.”"
Platts OPEC Is Producing Less Crude Than Its Supposed To.html,"OPEC+ is producing less oil than it is supposed to, a survey by Platts has revealed, as cited by Forex Live. The oil cartel was supposed to pump a combined 37.141 million barrels in September per its quotas, according to Argus. Yet, according to the Platts survey, the actual total was 570,000 bpd below this number—even if it was higher than the previous month by more than the 400,000 bpd OPEC+ agreed to add to the market every month. In other words, while OPEC+ was overperforming on its monthly production boost, it was underperforming on its own quotas.
 The September total, per the Argus data, was 6.712 million barrels lower than the baseline production level agreed to by OPEC+. The cartel has made no secret of its intention to go cautiously about production recovery. Its members appear still worried about the demand prospects for oil despite the recent price surge resulting from the gas supply crunch. It was this worry about demand that made OPEC+ stick to its original output recovery scheme of adding 400,000 bpd to monthly production until combined output rises by 5.8 million bpd. That would still mean a lower output than before the pandemic—OPEC+ slashed 7.7 million bpd from its production to counter the pandemic—and could keep prices higher for longer.
 In other words, OPEC+ is still prioritizing its own well-being despite calls for adding more barrels to curb a price rise that saw Brent crude top $80 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate pass this threshold for the first time in more than five years. The most notable call to OPEC to pump more came from Washington earlier this year, not once but twice. Now, Reuters reports, the White House remains eager to have OPEC ""do more"" to help global economic recovery, according to an unnamed official. The official said Washington was ""using every tool at our disposal to address anti-competitive practices in U.S. and global energy markets to ensure reliable and stable energy markets."""
Why 80 Wont Kill Oil Demand.html,"The $80 per barrel threshold may not be the limit for oil prices in the coming months as global demand recovery continues and record natural gas prices spur more demand for oil products for power generation and heating.  Despite the still lingering concerns over the Delta variant in many countries, mobility in developed economies continues to narrow the gap with 2019 levels amid higher vaccination rates and strong economic recovery. Although developing economies in South and Southeast Asia are still imposing intermittent localized lockdowns, oil demand globally continues to grow and is set to reach pre-pandemic levels within a few months.   So, 2019 was not the year of peak oil demand, as some analysts predicted in the first half of 2020 when COVID had most of the world on lockdown.   In addition, the skyrocketing natural gas and power prices are boosting the overall energy market rally and are set to result in more oil product demand in a gas-to-oil switch, especially in parts of Asia.  On Friday, the U.S. benchmark, WTI Crude, broke above $80 per barrel for the first time since 2014 as the world scrambles for energy supplies for the winter. Early on Monday, oil continued to rise in Asian trade, with Brent Crude topping $84 and WTI at $82.  The rally in prices is not only the result of the energy supply crisis in Europe and Asia.  Global oil demand continues to recover at a healthy pace, although the pandemic is still with us, Ed Crooks, Wood Mackenzie’s Vice-Chair, Americas, notes. 
  The pandemic is still a factor on the global oil market, but “its impact on the world economy and on energy demand is fading,” Crooks wrote in a commentary on Friday.  WoodMac - like many other consultancies, analysts, and oil majors - expects global demand worldwide, even at its uneven pace across regions, to reach pre-COVID levels by the third quarter of 2022.  This quarter, global oil demand is forecast to grow to around 99 million barrels per day (bpd), up from 97 million bpd in the third quarter, when demand rose by 6 percent compared to the third quarter of 2020, according to Wood Mackenzie. Oil demand globally is recovering from the summer Delta variant spike faster than some observers had expected. Then, soaring prices of natural gas and coal in Europe and Asia are forcing more gas-to-oil switching at power generating units globally, further pushing up demand for oil.  Many analysts and oil companies see global oil demand returning to the pre-crisis levels of 2019 as early as the start of next year, if not earlier, by the end of 2021.  Oil demand in the United States is at the forefront of recovery, with petroleum product demand over the summer approaching its all-time highs at about 21 million bpd, Wood Mackenzie’s Crooks notes. 
 “Mobility data show that even as the Delta variant of Covid-19 caused a surge in US infections, people kept driving,” he added.  The rollout of vaccines in developing economies in Asia will likely ease the pressure for intermittent lockdowns in the region. The countries with slower demand recovery than the U.S. can be expected to catch up, according to Suzanne Danforth, Wood Mackenzie’s Americas markets lead for downstream oil.  “The rebound in high-income countries with high vaccination rates is giving an indication of what other countries can look forward to,” WoodMac says.  As demand recovery continues, the supply side is also putting upward pressure on oil prices, after OPEC+ decided last week to keep plans for easing the cuts unchanged, despite calls for more supply from consuming countries, including the United States. OPEC+ will increase supply in November by 400,000 bpd - the minimum the market was expecting ahead of the meeting.   Tightening oil and other energy commodity markets have rekindled speculation about how high oil prices could go and whether they could reach $100 a barrel, especially if this winter in the northern hemisphere turns out colder than usual.  The $80 a barrel threshold is typically seen as the trigger of demand destruction, but with tight natural gas and coal markets globally, this winter’s demand-destruction price point could be higher. "
A Successful Energy Transition Will Need Oil Demand Destruction.html,"There’s a dark secret about the energy transition that politicians and energy regulators all too frequently shy away from. Unfortunately, unless this issue is dealt with the energy transition may never take place. The world consumes ever-growing amounts of energy as its total population increases, led by emerging markets that, in addition to strong population growth, are seeing an increase in the average wealth of their citizens. Any increase in wealth leads to more consumption of everything, energy included. And if countries are distracted by climate change discussions and rush into emission targets and renewable capacity, a shortage of energy supply follows. This is what we are currently witnessing in Europe and Asia. Stringent carbon dioxide emission regulations and a campaign to discourage investment in fossil fuel development in Europe have increased the continent’s heavy dependence on imported energy despite ambitions to increase self-sufficiency in energy by building massive wind and solar power capacity. Meanwhile, in Asia, economies were getting back on their feet after pandemic-prompted lockdowns and energy consumption surged. Suddenly, there was too much demand and too little gas, coal, and even oil. And while oil supply could be boosted relatively quickly because OPEC+ has been holding back supply, gas and coal have turned out to be trickier because of things like underinvestment and plant closures. Related: WTI Crude Oil Price Hits 7-Year High  Despite the underinvestment, the cold shoulder of asset managers, the environmentalist protests, and the denunciation of natural gas as a bridge fuel between the fossil fuel era and the post-fossil fuel era, demand for these - demand for energy of any kind as long as it’s reliable - has been on the rise. And this is what needs to change if the Paris Agreement agenda is to be met.
 A group of UK researchers put it bluntly last year. In a report calling for not net-zero but absolute zero, they suggested that “We need to switch to using electricity as our only form of energy and if we continue today’s impressive rates of growth in non-emitting generation, we’ll only have to cut our use of energy to 60% of today’s levels.” An energy consumption cut of “only” 40 percent would be quite a feat. The authors of the above report proposed things like switching to heat pumps and smaller cars among the things people can do to affect this particular change, along with using public transport more and buying more efficient equipment. Let’s forget for a moment the concept of planned obsolescence, which makes some of the proposals impossible to put into practice, and focus on the whole idea of reducing energy consumption. There is a reason this idea is not among the most popular energy transition topics among those in charge of decision-making. No politician has ever won elections by telling voters to consume less of anything. The reason no politician has done this is that telling people they should consume less of anything causes anxiety and fear, and ultimately loses elections. Yet as the current situation with energy availability in Europe and Asia shows, unless we somehow kill demand for energy the chances of the energy transition succeeding are slim. Human history is a clear example that, without state intervention, the trend is always towards growing consumption - except during recessions, when we tighten our belts, only to loosen them again as soon as the economy starts looking up.  Related: Gas Prices In Europe Are Now The Equivalent Of $205 Oil What’s more, there are already hundreds of millions of people without access to electricity. A lot of transition talk has been focused on getting clean, affordable power to these hundreds of millions of people, and yet little has been done because it is simply unprofitable. And more millions are coming.
 There has been a concerted effort on the part of politicians and institutions to present the energy transition as a straightforward no-brainer. We simply replace dirty oil, coal, and gas power plants with solar and wind farms, and voila, we get clean and affordable power. As Britain’s PM Boris Johnson put it, it’s easy to be green. Only it’s not. Being truly green would require, in addition to massive investments in utility-scale renewable installations and storage, a substantial reduction in energy demand. Whether this would mean giving up cars and dryers in favor of bicycles and natural drying in the sun and wind - and whether this would be enough - is yet unclear. For now, the idea is to switch to electric cars rather than shun personal transportation as a whole. And there is already opposition to the mandatory phasing out of ICE vehicles in parts of Europe. Remember the yellow vest protests in France? They were ignited by a proposal to increase fuel taxes for environmental purposes. That was perhaps supposed to sap demand for fuel but instead led to quite violent protests. Energy demand destruction is the only way the energy transition would work. And yet, it is the one thing no one wants to do, not directly, at least, because it could be dangerous. "
Oil Supply Adequate For Now But Larger Supply Crunch Looms.html,"Global oil supply will be enough to meet demand in the short and medium term, but the world is headed towards a supply shortage after 2026 unless the oil industry boosts investment in new projects, participants at last week’s Energy Intelligence Forum 2021 said. In the immediate future and in the next few years, global oil supply will be adequate to meet demand, because of the available spare capacity which the OPEC+ group is currently idling in their deal and the supply expected to come from already sanctioned new projects, according to most of the industry professionals who took part in the forum.                                                However, after the mid-2020s, the world will need either more new supply to meet growing demand or a reduction in demand if it is to stave off a supply crisis, industry officials and analysts said.
 Some of those officials have already started to call for more investment in new supply, considering the long lead times in conventional projects from discovery to production. For example, Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive at France’s TotalEnergies, said at the Energy Intelligence Forum that oil prices would “rocket to the roof” by 2030 if the industry were to stop investments in new supply, as some scenarios for net-zero by 2050 suggest.  “If we stop investing in 2020, we leave all these resources in the ground ... and then the price will rocket to the roof. And even in developed countries it will be a big issue,” Pouyanné said at the forum, as carried by Energy Intelligence.
 Global annual upstream spending needs to increase by as much as 54 percent to $542 billion if the oil market is to avert the next supply shortage shock, Moody’s said last week. “Our analysis demonstrates that upstream companies will need to increase their spending considerably for the medium term to fully replace reserves and avoid declines in future production,” Moody’s Vice President Sajjad Alam said."
Irans Oil Minister Presents Creative Plan To Draw In New Crude Oil Investment.html,"Iran is offering crude oil in exchange for goods or investments in its oil industry, oil minister Javad Owji told Iranian TV, as quoted by Bloomberg. The plan has yet to be approved by the Iranian parliament, Owji said. It remained unspecified whether it was targeting local or foreign investors. The overall sentiment, however, is optimistic, thanks to the latest developments on the oil and gas markets that favor oil producers. The plan to attract investments in oil and gas in exchange for output follows another announcement made by Iran's new oil minister last month. In it, Owji said Iran planned to attract some $145 billion in local and foreign investments in its fossil fuel industry.
 ""We plan to invest $145 billion in the development of the upstream and downstream oil industry over the next four to eight years, hence I welcome the presence of domestic and foreign investors in the industry,"" Owji said during a meeting with executives from China's Sinopec. China is Iran's biggest trade partner and one of the very few countries still importing some crude oil from Iran despite the U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic's oil exports and oil industry. It is also the world's biggest oil importer. 
 Meanwhile, the prospects of Iran shaking off U.S. sanctions remain uncertain. This weekend, the Islamic Republic's foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, said Iran placed a priority on verifying that U.S. sanctions will be lifted once talks resumed again. ""Of course, we will soon return to the Vienna talks and we are keeping our eyes on the issue of verification and receiving the necessary guarantees for the implementation of commitments by the Western parties,"" Amirabdollahian told Iranian media, as quoted by Reuters. At the same time, however, ""Given the pace of its nuclear advancements, Iran is nearing the point at which the nuclear deal's nonproliferation benefits will be unrecoverable without major changes to the accord, at which Tehran would balk,"" said analysts from Eurasia Group, as quoted by CNBC."
High Natural Gas Prices Could Lead To 2 Million Bpd Extra Oil Demand.html,"Oil prices have vaulted to multi-year highs after OPEC and other major producers opted last week against increasing output by more than previously agreed. However, it's the natural gas trajectory that has been hogging the limelight after gas prices surged more than 300% to trade at its highest levels since 2014, outpacing oil and many other commodities. With the global energy market remaining on fire, natural gas prices are increasingly impacting crude oil as well, with consumers looking for cheaper fuels to substitute. Indeed, a major anomaly has now emerged: Power producers are doing an about-face by switching from costly natural gas to oil, a reversal from the decade-long trend of transitioning from costly oil to cheaper and cleaner natural gas. It's a budding but rapidly growing trend that could boost global crude demand by a good 2 million b/d in the space of just a few years. Gas trading at the equivalent of $200 per barrel of oil  Gas demand in Europe and Asia, particularly from China, has remained heightened this year due to adverse weather and also as economies emerge from lockdowns. Natural gas markets have lately been energized by expectations of rebounding demand in the looming northern hemisphere winter as insufficient levels of inventories ahead of the winter season have been driving a spike in natural gas prices.  The natural gas rally started in Europe several months ago but has been spreading like wildfire to the rest of the world. 
 To put the current elevated prices into perspective, experts are saying that gas prices are now trading at the equivalent of more than $200 per barrel of oil, with Europe and Asia the hardest hit, making oil look dirt-cheap in comparison despite its own impressive rally. German power prices for 2022 delivery have surged to €120/MWh, more than 3X the average seen during the previous five years while the price of Dutch TTF first month gas has shot up to nearly €85/MWh or $29/MMBtu or more than 5X higher than the five-year average. Meanwhile, U.S. traded natural gas prices recently surged to a seven-year high at $6.25/MMBtu. Market experts are now warning that runaway gas prices are likely to ratchet up demand for crude by encouraging gas-to-oil switching and exacerbate the current supply deficit in the oil markets. A combination of supply shortages and lower-than-expected power generation from renewables is forcing utilities to increasingly turn to natural gas and coal in order to maintain the required baseload across the electrical grid. ""This has never happened before at such a global scale. The market has always tried to substitute from costly oil to much cheaper natural gas,"" Bjarne Schieldrop, chief SEB commodities analyst, has told Reuters. The magnitude and speed of the switch varies among energy experts. Schieldrop has put the demand boost at 500,000 b/d, similar to Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser's estimate.
 JP Morgan has put the potential boost in oil-fired power generation by power generators switching to oil as high as 2 million bpd but says 750,000 b/d by March is more realistic. Meanwhile, the normally conservative International Energy Agency (IEA) has placed the demand bump at a more modest 200,000 b/d and says the switch will be more rampant in Indonesia, Pakistan, the Middle Eastern states and Bangladesh. No longer business as usual It's no longer business as usual in the oil markets, and the old saying that the best cure for high prices is high prices is unlikely to work. The big difference this time around is that the focus on ESG and green transformation has reached a fever pitch and effectively curtailed producers' normal long-cycle capex response to surging prices and rising demand i.e., boosting production. Without such a quick response from producers, it appears that the only path is to leave the markets to their own devices until prices reach a level where they trigger demand destruction.  But with the likes of JP Morgan recently saying that the economy can handle $150 oil, other analysts saying hyperinflation will see oil prices hit $180/barrel by the end of 2022 and OPEC+ clearly willing to defend higher prices, it will be interesting to see how far this oil bull will run."
Lebanons Unravelling Economy Could Have A Major Geopolitical Impact.html,"Crisis-riven Lebanon appears on the brink of collapse once again. The deeply divided Mediterranean country, which was engulfed by a sectarian civil war for 15 years from 1975 to 1990, finds itself caught in a profound economic crisis.  As Lebanon’s economy unravels with power blackouts as well as shortages of gasoline, medicine and basic foodstuffs common place political instability in the deeply divided country is ratcheting ever upward. The economic implosion, described by the World Bank as one the most severe crises globally, has impoverished over three-quarters of Lebanon’s population poses the greatest threat to Lebanon’s stability since the civil war that lasted from 1975 to 1990.  Late last month yet another Lebanese government was formed by President Michel Aoun, a Christian Maronite, with it led by Sunni Muslim business tycoon Prime Minister Najib Mikati. The unwillingness of Lebanon’s ruling elite to relinquish power, break the status quo and implement serious reforms indicates that the political system is broken meaning the Mediterranean country will remain locked in a deep crisis for the foreseeable future. This could tip Lebanon into civil war, once again, with the fallout spreading across the Middle East and impacting oil prices at a crucial time in the global economic recovery. 
  Aside from the new government’s disinclination to implement serious reforms no western state or international body has offered to assist Lebanon with resolving the crisis while pro-reform political candidates were the biggest losers in the reshuffle. Analysts believe that militant Shia political and social organization Hezbollah holds considerable sway over the new government. Those tensions are being exacerbated by the influx of Syrian refugees from that Middle Eastern country’s long-running civil war, the Palestinian issue, and friction with neighboring Israel. The latest events are not only causing domestic tensions to soar but have created an ideal opportunity for Hezbollah to expand its already considerable sway over domestic affairs. The group, formed by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in 1982 and is classified as a terrorist organization by the U.S. as well as other western powers, is attempting to fill the void left by a weak state.  Hezbollah, already emboldened by the rapid collapse of the U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan, imported four million liters of fuel on 80 trucks from the Syrian port of Baniyas last month. Teheran had facilitated the shipment by transporting the fuel to Syria so that it could be trucked through Hezbollah-controlled territory to Lebanon. The Shia militant organization is a powerful proxy for Teheran in its never-ending conflict with Riyadh for control of the Middle East. While many Lebanese are suspicious of Hezbollah and its goals, particularly with the organization using its parliamentary presence to undermine state institutions, many are so desperate they are unwilling to turn down access to vital fuels and foodstuffs. This is bolstering Hezbollah’s credibility as the savior of Lebanon, especially with the group’s leadership claiming that fuel shortages are the result of U.S. sanctions on Iran rather than a result of the economic crisis and Beirut’s mismanagement. That has significantly bolstered Hezbollah’s domestic influence further enhancing its leverage over Lebanon’s government.

The rapidly deteriorating economy is reflected by gross domestic product shrinking by a whopping 25% during 2020 which will be followed by an expected 8.5% contraction for 2021. This is profoundly impacting Lebanon’s currency, the pound, sparking hyperinflation causing the prices of basic goods to soar and poverty to surge. During 2020 inflation surged by 88% compared to 2.9% a year earlier and is forecast to reach 120%, or potentially higher, in 2021. That makes the pound essentially worthless magnifying the hardships now being faced by many Lebanese with shortages of fuels and staple foods such as pita bread commonplace. It is estimated, because of the economy’s accelerating downward spiral, that 78% of Lebanon’s population lives in poverty with 36% in extreme poverty. According to the UN starvation is fast becoming a reality for many Lebanese. This rapid economic decline is fanning the flames of civil dissent causing fears of revolution or civil war to mount, especially with successive governments in Beirut proving incapable of ending the economic catastrophe which is fast turning into a political and humanitarian crisis. This is particularly worrying when it is considered that Hezbollah, through the support of Iran, has a militia capable of challenging Lebanon’s armed forces. The geopolitical impact of an increasingly unstable Lebanon on the Middle East is tremendous with it having the potential to cause crude oil prices to spike. That is evident from the massive 2020 explosion which rocked Beirut’s port causing the Brent price to gain 3% between August 3 and August 12, 2020, as traders feared that any ensuing violence would spill over into Lebanon’s neighbors. If Lebanon were to collapse into civil war or Hezbollah attempted to seize power outright, it would trigger an oil price shock at what is a critical juncture for the world’s post-pandemic economic recovery. Brent has soared by over 8% since the start of July 2021 and is expected to rise further with some analysts tipping $100 a barrel of oil before the end of 2021. That would be a major inflationary blow for a global economy still recovering from the pandemic and already battling a series of supply crunches. A stronger Hezbollah also poses a threat to stability in Latin America with the organization, along with its sponsor Iran, having built a substantial presence in Venezuela where it is engaged in a range of illicit activities."
US Rig Count Climbs As Crude Prices Rally.html,"The number of oil and gas rigs in the United States rose by 5 this week, according to Baker Hughes, bringing the total number of additions since the start of the summer to 85. The total rig count is now at 533, up 264 from this time last year, steadfastly making up lost ground from the 790 active rigs as of March 2020. The U.S. oil rig count rose this week to 433—a 5-rig increase. The number of gas and miscellaneous rigs again stayed the same.
 The EIA’s estimate for oil production in the United States for the week ending October 1 rose 200,000 bpd, to an average of 11.3 million barrels per day—now just 200,000 bpd under pre-Hurricane Ida levels as producers appear to have brought back online most of the production lost during the hurricane. Canada’s overall rig count increased by 2. Active oil and gas rigs in Canada are now at 167, up 87 on the year.  The rig count in the Permian Basin rose by 3 this again week, while the number of rigs in the Eagle Ford rose by 1.  The Permian’s total rig count is now 136 rigs above what it was this time last year.
 Primary Vision’s Frac Spread Count, which tracks the number of completion crews finishing off previously drilled wells, shows that completion crews rose by 5 to 262 for week ending October 1. The frac count is up by almost 130 for the year. At 12:00 p.m. EDT, oil prices were trending up on the day. WTI was trading at $79.82—up 1.94% on the day and more than $4 on the week.  The Brent benchmark was trading at $83.28 78.56—up 1.62% on the day and nearly $5 per barrel on the week.  "
